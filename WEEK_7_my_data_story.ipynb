Specifically, I reinforced my knowledge of safely opening and reading text files using try-except blocks for error handling and the with open statement for proper resource management. Beyond basic reading, I explored text processing methods like splitlines() and split() to extract structured information such as line counts, word counts, and character counts. Identifying the first, last, and longest lines also provided practical application of string manipulation and list indexing. This iterative process of building and refining code, coupled with clear explanations, truly enhanced my grasp of writing robust and well-commented Python scripts for text file analysis.\n",
