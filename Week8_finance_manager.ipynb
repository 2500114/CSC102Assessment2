        "## Explain `load_transactions` Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The `load_transactions` function is designed to **safely read and process lines from a specified transaction file**.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Overall Purpose**: The primary goal of this function is to abstract away the details of file handling and provide a clean list of transaction strings, ensuring that each string is free of leading/trailing whitespace and that no empty lines are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **File Reading (`with open(...)`)**: The function uses a `with open(filename, 'r') as file:` statement to open the file. This is Python's recommended way to handle files because it ensures that the file is **automatically closed** even if errors occur during reading. The `'r'` argument specifies that the file should be opened in read mode.\n",
        "    -   `file.readlines()`: This method reads all lines from the opened file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string represents a line from the file, including the newline character `\\n` at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Error Handling (`try-except FileNotFoundError`)**: To make the function robust, it includes a `try-except FileNotFoundError` block. This block gracefully handles situations where the specified `filename` does not exist. If a `FileNotFoundError` occurs:\n",
        "    -   It prints an informative message to the user: `File '{filename}' not found!`\n",
        "    -   It then returns an **empty list `[]`**, indicating that no transactions could be loaded, which prevents the program from crashing and allows for subsequent logic to handle the absence of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Line Processing Logic (`[line.strip() for line in lines if line.strip()]`)**: After reading the lines, the function processes them using a list comprehension:\n",
        "    -   `line.strip()`: For each `line` read from the file, the `.strip()` method is called. This method removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, and newline characters like `\\n`) from the string.\n",
        "    -   `if line.strip()`: This is a conditional filter. It evaluates the stripped version of each `line`. If `line.strip()` results in an empty string (meaning the original line was either entirely empty or contained only whitespace), it evaluates to `False` in a boolean context. Therefore, only lines that contain actual content (i.e., `line.strip()` is not an empty string) are included in the final list. This effectively **filters out blank lines or lines containing only whitespace**."

        "The hardest part of this project was building the process_transactions() function because the data was messy, unpredictable, and required careful error handling to keep the program from crashing. I had to think about multiple possible problems—missing commas, non-numeric values, and completely broken lines—and make sure each one was handled safely without stopping the rest of the data from being processed. AI helped by guiding me step-by-step through the logic, showing me how to use try-except blocks effectively, and helping me design a clean structure that could skip bad lines while still creating accurate dictionaries for the valid ones. This made the function much easier to build and understand."
