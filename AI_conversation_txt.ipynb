The fine is $0.50 per day, with a maximum of $10.00, and the program should also handle the case where the fine reaches the maximum by showing a clear message. Inputs and outputs Inputs: Days overdue: Number of days the book is returned late (non-negative integer). Outputs: Fine amount: Currency value to two decimal places, capped at $10.00. Special case: If the calculated fine exceeds $10.00, show “Maximum fine reached” and $10.00. Work the problem by hand Case A: Book is 5 days late My calculation: Base fine: 5 days × $0.50/day = $2.50 Cap check: $2.50 ≤ $10.00 → no cap applied Fine: $2.50 Case B: Book is 25 days late My calculation: Base fine: 25 days × $0.50/day = $12.50 Cap check: $12.50 > $10.00 → apply cap Fine: $10.00 Special note: The fine would have been $12.50, but the library’s policy caps fines at $10.00, so we show “Maximum fine reached.” Case C: Book is 0 days late Fine: $0.00\n",
